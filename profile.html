My name is Sierra Seacat and I am currently a junior attending the University of Kansas. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Physics and hope to do
something cool in those areas one day. I probably like music more than anything else. I listen to music of varying genres, though my main focus is indie rock.
I also have a variety other interests ranging from politics to astronomy to hiking to film.
