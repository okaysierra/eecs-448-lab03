    <p>These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.</p>

<p>I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. We need dark in order to show light. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Let's put a touch more of the magic here.</p>

<p>Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.</p>

<p>They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers just to upset the critics. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.</p>

<p>A beautiful little sunset. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Every day I learn.</p>

<p>I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. I like to beat the brush.</p>

<p>Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. There are no limits in this world. Let's do that again.</p><br>
